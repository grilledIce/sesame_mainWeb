            <h3>What is Sesame Coin?</h3>
            <div>
                Sesame Coin is the only currency on the platform. You may use it for the monthly membership fee, and your referral fee when you close the deal with Sesame leads. It can be purchased under  “My Account” and it is non-refundable. One Canadian Dollar can buy 10 Sesame Coins.
            </div>
            <h3>Where can I check my Sesame Coins balance?</h3>
            <div>
                Check your Sesame Coins balance in “My account”. Every time when the balance is not sufficient for the monthly fee, you will get a notification.
            </div>
            <h3>How to purchase my Sesame Coins? Is there any other way to get Sesame Coins except paying?</h3>
            <div>
                Go to “My account” and follow the payment instruction. You will receive your email receipt every time as soon as the payment goes through. There is a welcome package for new Realtors that Sesame will assign you Sesame Coins every month for the whole first year, as long as you visit Sesame at least once every month. Sesame will also have frequent events and promotions for our hard-working Realtors who deserve better profits.
            </div>
            <h3>Does Sesame keep my payment information?</h3>
            <div>
                No. Sesame assign a secure third-party entity to make the payment done. Sesame will not keep any credit card or other payment information on its own system.
            </div>
            <h3>If I get the leads from Sesame and the deal closed successfully, how many Sesame Coins should I pay to Sesame?</h3>
            <div>
                A referral agreement must be signed between Realtors and Sesame Booking prior to the offers sent to clients. Sesame will try every effort to collect leads to make our Realtors get more business. As a result, it charges 1000 Sesame Coins (about 100 CAD) as a referral fee per lease deal closed with Sesame clients, or 15% of the amount of commission received by agents if there is a purchase/sell deal successfully closed with Sesame clients. Realtors can read the referral agreement for more details.
